# HTML Essential training

## 1 HTML intro
- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
- It is a markup intended for the browser as the user don't see the tags and attributes so it is more important to browsers, yet we need to carefully communicate our messages to be understood
- For styling use CSS
- For interactivity use Javascript
- HTML is intended for all type of devices and systems
- HTML is simple markup language with no programming logic associated
- forgiving language which works even with mistakes, can take a lot of abuse
- CSS is a bit more fragile and a bit more powerful, if selector is wrong it is ignored
- Javascript is the more powerful and more fragile, if errors a page will break
- HTML, CSS, Javascript => resilience, robustness and power
- if you can put something in HTML then use HTML, if you can't use CSS and JS
## 2 Formatting text
- __use opening and closing tag__ to close element, not every element needs to be closed anymore
- __elements can be nested__, paring, children, siblings
- __Document Object Model DOM__ tree name is used
- [paragraph element demo on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/bGbooGB)
- __headlines__ are important to identify different sections of a page, h1 tag most important, h6 the less important
- [demo of the headlines](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/aboLEwE), h1 is the main title, h2 is the subtitle, don't pick headline based on how it looks but go for the meaning of the content
- headlines are important for screen readers
- look for 'design systems' and ways how the meaning for bigger and content rich websites are defined
- __important and emphasized__ => `em, strong, i, b` - forget `i, b` as you can always markup text with css as you like, if you want to convey something as strong use strong tag and you want to emphasize something use em
- strong => importance, seriousness, urgency
- em => emphasis, clarification, highlight, emotional nuance
- it is important to markup these elements correctly for people listening to our content
- __Lists__: to do lists, recipe lists, wishlist, bucket lists, but also navigation
- three kinds: unordered list, ordered list, definition list
- ul and ol uses li elements
- dl - definition lists and you have dt definition term inside with one or more dd definition description or data at the same level
- demo of lists [different lists on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/eYOyoJO), can change the layout of the lists, also the numbering scheme
- __Quotes__: distinguish from the surrounding text, you have `blockquote` for block type quotation and `q` for inline elements
- inline elements are flowing with the text and they don't start new line, block level elements are starting a new line and can have width and height
- __Dates__: one element `time` with `datetime` attribute, not visible for users but mark the time for computers and search engines
- many possibilities with `time`, need to check the documentation, look at the [MDN Time element reference](https://lnkd.in/g7eqZhE)
- __code, pre, br__ elements: when you want to display HTML element on page but don't want to render it as actual element of the page itself you use HTML entities or `&somethinghere;` to mark it up
- [example poem problem](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/VwZQBvJ) - this is the classic poem problem when you want to display a text by respecting the new lines in it
- if you want to display the text with all of the white space respected you use `pre` tag to enclose it [pre and code example](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/gOYvjpa)
- __superscript, subscript and small text__ : subscript like in H<sub>2</sub>O formula and on the other side if mathematical expression for example x<sup>2</sup> and also footnotes<sup>[3]</sup>
- here is [example on codepen](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/LYPQdMV)
- for `small` you can use it to markup small print like in legal documents, frequently used in copyright information for example
## 3 Understanding the power of HTML
- [some code to investigate with Inspector](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/xxKjYRR) - on each browser you invoke Inspector with `ctrl+shift+I`, look at the tab `Elements`
- good idea is to investigate code from other websites to see how people are using elements and tags
- __HTML attributes__ : global and local attributes, common global are: class, id, lang, dir and many more
- __ARIA roles__ : for accessibility situations, provide accessible information about a specific element
- __Formatting HTML__ : comments, you have block comments and inline comments, the closing slash is not needed for some elements like img, br, hr, input and else
- __Weird characters__ : also called entities, you have `&nbsp;` which means non breaking space you mark a place where you want the text to stay together, opposite is `<wbr>` where the text if needed breaks at this place, but if you want the text to break with a dash indicating that the word on the next line is part of the previous word you use `&shy;` 
## 4 Linking and navigation
- __Links__: by default `a` element is an inline element, can wrap link around img element, can wrap around teaser element
- there are absolute urls like `https://example.com/2020/10/14/my-blog-post`
- there are relative urls in two forms - first if we have `/` we instruct the browser to go and look from the top level of the site, the second type is if we omit the leading slash then the path is relative to our current position of the file we are working in from
- for example we have `/images/logo.gif` and `../images/logo.gif` for a styles.css file located one folder down in folder names CSS
- every time we told a browser go and look at URL which is a folder the browser looks for index.html file inside, it works only for HTML files and NOT for CSS and image files
- `href="/people/index.html"` , `href="/people/"` , `href="/people"` all of this three urls goes to the exactly same place
- __Navigation__ : `<nav aria-label='Breadcrumb'>`, `<nav role="navigation" aria-label="main-menu">`
## 5 Images
- `img` tag, src attribute, alt attribute and possibly width and height
- make alt descriptive if for some reason the image doesn't load
- width and height are optional
- if we explicitly tell the browser what dimensions to use, it doesn't have to look at the file for sizes after the image file has been downloaded
- on old pages when the browser downloads the image without knowing the size the content of the page keep moving until the image is downloaded, if internet connection is too slow this is very annoying
- __Image formats__ : high quality vs small file size
- gif is the oldest, good for illustration, 256 colors, good compression for large areas of single color, can do transparency with jagged edges, can do also animation
- svg, logs icons, it is a math instruction, made of vector, scale very smoothly, very small file size, if you can use it use it
- jpg image format for compressing photos but also there is webp alternative around, if not compressed very big file size
- png, good if you need transparency, good at compression
- you need to experiment to find what works and what not
- consider the physical size, the image format and compressing settings
- __Responsive images__  based on density: you don't want to deliver high res data to small screens and increase download time
- use the power of html and list several image files to deliver to different screens look at [example at codepen.io](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/QWLxgMy), the 1x, 2x and more in the code sample is the pixel density - where for one pixel of your image there are 2 or more pixels available on the device
- you create many copies of different dimensions and server what is appropriate
- [example of different sizes](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/jONeawJ), here the size is set for different screen density
 - __Variant with width of the viewport__ : [demo of viewport width](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pres/WNeyPXL), and [more demo viewport width](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pres/wvwXOYa) - the example works in firefox but not in edge at the time of trying the code
 - __Responsive pictures__ : picture element, [demo of the code](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/MWgXRgE?editors=1000), combining [multiple techniques](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/wvwXLQa?editors=1000)
 - __Figure and figcaption__ elements: enclose img with figure and inside add figcaption, provide browser with more semantic information about the picture, use figure element also for interactive graphic
 ## 6 Media
 - __Audio element__ : [example of audio element](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pen/BaBVdWp?editors=1000), as you see there are `controls` attribute and `source` elements, there is also `loop` and `autoplay` 
 - we need to use multiple source elements because of compatibility issues, so the src attribute becomes source element
 - we have mp3, ogg, aac, wav, aiff and the browser use the first playable format it founds
 - put some fallback text before the closing audio element to inform users who are not able to play any of the files
 - __Video element__ : like the audio element there are opening and closing tags, point to sources with source element
 - file size is important when working with video
 - very popular codecs are h.264-not open sources, WebM video codec but still in development, also AV1 is on the horizon, HEVC h.265
 - [demo with video element](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pres/VwZdzBe)
 - there is no solution how we send different video file under different network conditions and different screens, this is because the network speed is often variable and for each fetch the browser need to make a decision which quality is appropriate - adaptive bitrate streaming and requires a server farm of transcoding robots
 - __Captions and subtitles__ : some people needs captions and subtitles to understand the content. We use `track` element and provide txt document. On the web we want the `wvtt` format `<track src="somefile.vtt">` and [for the demo follow the link](https://codepen.io/jensimmons/pres/KKPevBe),we use `kind=captions` and `label=english` to show english as a choice on the video player controls, `srclang="en"` to tell the browser what is the language, there is also `kind="descriptions"` for a video where the content is described if a person can't look at it, `kind="chapters"` gives the user a way to jump around the chapters
 - __Embed other media through iframes__ : you can embed a map from Google, code demo from Codepen, each service offers a way to embed content, there are some security considerations
