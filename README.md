# HTML Master

## Purpose of this repo is to hold all of the samples from different courses into single location

The courses taken are listed below and the structure is as follows:
- Top level is a folder with the name of a course
- Inside are different subfolders holding the separate chapters of the course in question
- At the same level, test folder with different variants is situated
- Some courses are more theoretic than others and .md files for these cases are more appropriate
- This repo is intended to be a documentation place as well as a testing ground
- Any contributions are pretty much welcome as I am learning my way around Git
