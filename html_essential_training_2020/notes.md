# HTML Essential training

## 1 HTML intro
- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
- It is a markup intended for the browser as the user don't see the tags and attributes so it is more important to browsers, yet we need to carefully communicate our messages to be understood
- For styling use CSS
- For interactivity use Javascript
- HTML is intended for all type of devices and systems
- HTML is simple markup language with no programming logic associated
- forgiving language which works even with mistakes, can take a lot of abuse
- CSS is a bit more fragile and a bit more powerful, if selector is wrong it is ignored
- Javascript is the more powerful and more fragile, if errors a page will break
- HTML, CSS, Javascript => resilience, robustness and power
- if you can put something in HTML then use HTML, if you can't use CSS and JS
